# SeatingChart

As an exercise, the solution was constrained by 20 minutes.  The idea was to create a seating chart that could take reservations, and hold information on the longest sequence of empty seats.  Finding the longest subsequence of empty seats took most of the time.  Dealing with Jva syntax as well (as Java isn't a language I use at work).
